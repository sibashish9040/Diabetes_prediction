#  🩺 Diabetes Prediction Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This project focuses on predicting whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. It uses the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for classification and provides insights through data visualization and performance evaluation.

## 📌 Objective

To build a machine learning model using SVM that predicts the presence of diabetes from a set of medical features.
